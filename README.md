## Phase 0 - The Bunny Image

```
* "Follow the white rabbit"
* Unwrap the squares counter-clockwise
* 8 squares per byte, ascii
* result is "gsmg.io/theseedisplanted"

## Phase 1 - The Warning

[Link to notebook](./phase1.ipynb)

* Post a password on a hidden form to "https://gsmg.io/phase1verification"
* The URL and pictures form lyrics from the song "The Warning" by _Logic_
* The line following "Phase two" is "The flower blossoms through what seems to be a concrete surface"
* password is the line all lowercase, no spaces "theflowerblossomsthroughwhatseemstobeaconcretesurface"
* We are redirected to [http://gsmg.io/choiceisanillusioncreatedbetweenthosewithpowerandthosewithoutaveryspecialdessertiwroteitmyself](http://gsmg.io/choiceisanillusioncreatedbetweenthosewithpowerandthosewithoutaveryspecialdessertiwroteitmyself)

## Phase 2 - Mr Robot

[Link to notebook](./phase2.ipynb)

### Phase 2.1

* Using the url and the text we get matrix quotes, which leads to "causality" as the password for the AES, and is part 1.
* Decoded AES has Mr. Robot references 
* Parts 2,3,4 words can be found to be "Safenet", "Luna", "HSM"

### Phase 2.2

* Brute force is used to find part 5 being "11110", the real path/reasoning hasn't been discovered or disclosed.
* Part 6 is a reference to the Genesis Block of bitcoin, and directly to a particular line in the source code leading to "0x736B6E616220726F662074756F6C69616220646E6F63657320666F206B6E697262206E6F20726F6C6C65636E61684320393030322F6E614A2F33302073656D695420656854" as part 6
* Part 7 is a chess puzzle where a white piece must be moved without causing check-mate. The final solution is "B5KR/1r5B/2R5/2b1p1p1/2P1k1P1/1p2P2p/1P2P2P/3N1N2 b - - 0 1"
* Putting everything together with the case hints and white space hints we get the final password as "causalitySafenetLunaHSM111100x736B6E616220726F662074756F6C69616220646E6F63657320666F206B6E697262206E6F20726F6C6C65636E61684320393030322F6E614A2F33302073656D695420656854B5KR"
* sha256 of that password is the key to decrypting phase 3


## Phase 3 - Free Will

[Link to notebook](./phase3.ipynb)

* First riddle refers to The Venus Project and the "thinker" is "Jacque Fresco"
* Second riddle refers to Alice in Wonderland, the answer to the quote is "just one second", password 2 is "giveitjustonesecond"
* Third riddle refers to the "Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle"
* Using the case and space hints we end up with "jacquefrescogiveitjustonesecondheisenbergsuncertaintyprinciple" as a final password

## Phase 3.2 

[Link to notebook](./phase3.2.ipynb)

* First blob is raw bytes that needs to be decoded with IBM EBCDIC 1141
* The resulting string is enciphered with a beaufort cipher (hinted at with "a beautiful strategic position")
* The key for the cipher is hinted at with "why am I here", a quote from the matrix, the next line being the key "thematrixhasyou".
* This reveals a long block of text that is yet to be solved
* The numbers are enciphered with a VIC Cipher. The numbers are hinted at earlier with "one for one, four for one", use number 1 and 4.
* The alphabet is given below the numbers "fubcd oracle thingky mvps" which must be modified to remove the second "c" and replaced with either "." or "/", after which, the missing alphabet can be added to give "fubcdora/lethingkymvpszjqwx."
* The resulting output has yet to be solved

## Decentraland

[Link to notebook](./decentraland.ipynb)

The decentraland hint along with the [2020 hint](#2020-01-14-hint) were the path leading to [SalPhaseIon](#salphaseion)

To solve decentraland hint:
* Go to decentraland location given in image
* Click the box, a sound will play
* Download the sound
* Open in an audio manipulation program
* Split left and right tracks
* Inverse one of the tracks
* Mix both tracks back together to reveal the hint "HASHTHETEXT"

## SalPhaseIon

[Link to notebook](./salphaseion.ipynb)

* split the string into part based upon like encoded strings
* decode the abba string using a=0, b=1, convert binary to ascii string to give "matrixsumlist"
* Split the next few sections using "z" as a separator
* the "agda" and "cfob" string are encoded the same way
    * o=0,a=1,b=2..., hex string -> ascii
    1. agda = lastwordsbeforearchichoice
    2. cfob = thispassword
* the remaining abba string is "enter"
* everything else hasn't been solved

## Cosmic Duality

This stage is currently unsolved.

# Further Hints and 2020-present Timeline

At the end of 2019, and early 2020, no one had publicly made progress passed the AES blob in phase 3.2. The following are either official hints, or various quotes that _might_ be hints.

## 2020-01-14 Hint

The creator gave a hint on the Telegram group on 2020-01-14:

![Roses are red](hints/2020-01-14-roses-are-red.png)

```
Roses are White but often Red.
Yellow has a number and so does Blue.
Go back to the first puzzle piece without further ado.

It might have shown you only one door, beware that the rabbits nest may contain a whole lot more.

Hush hush.
```

Unfortunately, no one publicly managed to decode it

## 2020-02-20 Hint

The creator gave a second hint: a screenshot from within [decentraland](https://decentraland.org/) at -41,-17 

![Decentraland hint](hints/decentraland-tg.png)

See how it's solved [here](./decentraland.ipynb)

## 2020-04-08

Not an official hint, and could be Jrk trolling

![Humph. Hope, it is the quintessential human delusion, simultaneously the source of your greatest strength, and your greatest weakness.](hints/2020-04-08.png)

> Humph. Hope, it is the quintessential human delusion, simultaneously the source of your greatest strength, and your greatest weakness.

## 2020-05-11

Bitcoin halving. Half of the prize was moved to [17ucy1K9ZUAaoY6JVtM932W9jUp5LXfyHa](https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/addresses/BTC/17ucy1K9ZUAaoY6JVtM932W9jUp5LXfyHa)

And Jrk mentions a second door.
```
Let's see what bitcoin is worth the next halving and who knows what you'll find after opening the 2nd door. The price is in half, but what does it mean 🤔.
```

![Alt text](hints/2020-05-11.png)

## 2020-06-07

The first public mention of SalPhaseIon (in the `#Crypto_Puzzles` discord channel)

![Alt text](hints/2020-06-07-salph-discord.png)

## 2020-08-02

Another mention of the extra door

![Alt text](hints/2020-08-02.png)

## 2021-01-21

Jrk hinting that people have reached the final stage. It can be seen from the Telegram chat, and discord chat - in retrospect - that some groups may have reached the final stage in late 2020, but did not publicly declare it. This is the first time it was confirmed someone had reached it.

![Alt text](hints/2021-01-21.png)

## 2021-02-12

The first mention of SalPhaseIon in Telegram

![Alt text](hints/2021-02-12-salph-mention.png)



## 2021-03-01

We get confirmation that spelling errors are not significant.

![Alt text](hints/2021-03-01-spelling-hint.png)

And we find out that there is a "prime part"

![Alt text](hints/2021-03-01-primes.png)

## 2021-03-14

More confirmation of salphaseion being the last phase.

![Alt text](hints/2021-03-14.png)

## 2021-04-01

An April Fools Hint. This might not be a real hint
```
R=18
A=1
B=2

Telegram message seems to debunk this.
```
![Alt text](<hints/2021-04-01-april fool.png>)

## 2021-04-16

The contents of SalphaseIon leak to telegram

![Alt text](hints/2021-04-16-salph.png)

## 2021-05-06

The instructions for salph are finally revealed "hash the text on the image"

![Alt text](<hints/2021-05-06-salph instructions.png>)

### Discussion
It is revealed that the way to get to salphaseion is by taking all the text on the initial image - including the bitcoin address - and then taking a hash of hte result will give you the url needed to enter salphaseion.
```python
>>> import hashlib
>>> h = hashlib.sha256()
>>> h.update('GSMGIO5BTCPUZZLECHALLENGE1GSMG1JC9wtdSwfwApgj2xcmJPAwx7prBe'.encode())
>>> h.hexdigest()
'89727c598b9cd1cf8873f27cb7057f050645ddb6a7a157a110239ac0152f6a32'
```

And so [https://gsmg.io/89727c598b9cd1cf8873f27cb7057f050645ddb6a7a157a110239ac0152f6a32](https://gsmg.io/89727c598b9cd1cf8873f27cb7057f050645ddb6a7a157a110239ac0152f6a32) is the link to SalPhaseIon

The theory of everything is a hint

![Alt text](<hints/2023-01-12-theory of everything.png>)


## 2023-02-23 - Official Hint

A seemingly binary string was posted as a hint, It's decoded to 
```
yellow blue primes matrix sumlist last words before archichoice yinyang 
we wont give away thepassword its in front of  your eyes but youre 
not seeing it very last step is a true give away promised
```

![Alt text](hints/2023-02-23.png)


## 2023-08-03 Hint

![Alt text](hints/2023-08-03-1.png)

"the hardest part is done."

![Alt text](hints/2023-08-03-2.png)

### Discussion
It can be noted that the "..." we see in puzzles shows up, and might be replaced with "key". The whole sentence can be reinterpreted as meaning "Look for the key"


## 2023-08-06 Hint
